## Release Notes

### Version 1.3.0 Highlights

This release focuses on **enhanced usability** and **enterprise readiness**:

1. **Verbose Mode**: New `-v` flag allows real-time viewing of package installation output, making troubleshooting faster during interactive sessions.

2. **Flexible Installation**: New `--skip-base-packages` flag allows users to skip optional utility packages, useful for minimal environments or compliance requirements.

3. **Cloud Platform Examples**: Production-ready Terraform configurations for AWS, GCP, and Azure with comprehensive documentation.

4. **Ansible Integration**: Complete Ansible playbook with vault integration, pre-flight checks, and post-conversion validation.

5. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages, individual package installation handling, and graceful degradation for optional components.

### Upgrade Path

No breaking changes from 1.2.0 â†’ 1.3.0. Simply download the new version:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o convert2rhel-setup https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khodaparastan/convert2rhel-automation/main/convert2rhel-setup
chmod +x convert2rhel-setup
```

### Version 1.2.0 Highlights

**Critical Fix**: The `--assume-yes` flag now properly passes `-y` to the convert2rhel tool, enabling **true unattended automation**. Previous versions would hang at convert2rhel's internal prompts even when `--assume-yes` was used.

**Breaking Change**: If you were using version 1.1.0 with `--assume-yes` in automation, you may have been handling convert2rhel prompts separately. Update your automation to rely on the script's built-in unattended mode.

### Version 1.1.0 Highlights

Added major workflow flexibility with analysis-only and skip-analysis modes, making the tool suitable for both cautious production environments and rapid testing scenarios.

### Version 1.0.0 Highlights

Initial stable release with core functionality for automated RHEL conversion.
